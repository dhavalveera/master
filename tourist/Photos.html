		<img class="img1" src="http://mausam.holiday/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mysorepalace.jpg">

		<h1 class="h1"> History of the Palace </h1>

		<ol>
			<li> A Treatment to the irrespressible spirit of the people of Mysuru and their Kings, the Mysuru Palace has survived political upheavals, diaster and destruction, only to rise out of the ashes more magnificent than ever. </li>
			<li> The Current Mysuru Palace - the fourth to occupy this site - was designed by the British architech Henry Irwin after its predecessor was destroyed is a fire in 1897. </li>
			<li> The imposing building that stands today was completed in 1912, but it is believed that a Mysuru Palace was Established as part of a wooden fortrees, by the royal family of Mysuru, the Wodeyars, as early as the fourteenth century. </li>
			<li> In 1638 the palace was struck by lightning and rebuilt by Kantirava Narasa Raja Wodeyar (1638 - 1659 AD), who extended the existing structures, adding new pavilions. </li>
			<li> The glory of the new building was to prove short-lived. The death of Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (1673 - 1704 AD) in the eighteenth century plunged the kingdom into a period of political instability. </li>
			<li> During these turbulent times the Mysuru Palace slipped into a state of neglect culminating in its demolition in 1793 by Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali, a maverick general in the king's army who rose to become the ruler of Mysuru. </li>
			<li> In 1799, when upon the death of Tipu Sultan the five-year old Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1794 - 1868)AD assumed the throne, the coronation ceremony took place under a marquee. One of the King's first task, on his accession, was to commission a new palace built in the Hindu arcitectural style and completed in 1803. </li>
			<li> The hastily constructed palace soon fell into disrepair and in 1897 was razed the ground by a fire at the wedding ceremony of Princess Jayalakshmmanni. </li>
			<li> The destiny of the Mysuru Palace now passed to Queen Regent Kempananjammanni Vanivilasa Sanndhihana, who commissioned well-known British architech Henry Irwin to build a new palace that would be a tribute to the legacy of Mysuru & the Wodeyars. </li>
			<li> Completed in 1912 and at a cost of Rs. 41,47,913 the result was the Mysuru Palace you see standing today. A masterpiece in Indo-Saracenic architecture, on par with great Mughal residence of the North & the stately colonial public buildings of the South. </li>

		<p class="p2"> History of Shaniwar Wada </p>

		<ol>
			<li> Shaniwarwada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune in Maharashtra, India. </li>
			<li> Built in 1732, it was the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818, when the Peshwas lost control to the British East India Company after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. </li>
			<li> Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace become the center of Indian politics in the 18th century. </li>
			<li> the Fort was itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by unexplained fire, but the surviving strcutres are now maintained as a tourist site. </li>
			<li> It was supposed to be made entirely of stone but after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of Sata (the national capital) complained to the Shahu (King) saying that a stone monument can be sancitioned & built only by the Shahu (King) himself & not the Peshwas. </li>
			<li> Following this, an Official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of bricks & not stone. </li>
			<li> the Wada was then completed & upon being attacked by the British Artillery 90 years later, all the top six stories collapsed leaving only the stone base, which was immune to the British Artillery. Hence only the stone base of the Shaniwar Wada remains & can be seen even today in the older parts of Pune. </li>
			<li> by 1758, at least a thousand of people lived in the fort. </li>
			<li> in 1773, Narayanrao, who was the fifth & ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao & aunt Anandibai. </li>
			<li> a Popular rumour says that Narayanrao's ghost still calls for help on full moon nights. </li>
			<li> Various people, working around the area, have allegedly reported such cries. Sound of <b> Kaka mala wachwa (Uncle save me) </b> by Narayanrao Peshawe after his death. </li>
			<li> in June 1818, Peshwa Bajirao II, abdicted his Gaddi (Throne) to Sir John Malcolm of the British East India Company & went into political exile at Bithoor, near Kanpur in Present-Day Uttar Pradesh, India. </li>
			<li> Peshwa Baji Rao I, Prime Minister to Chattrapati Shahu, laid the ceremonial foundation of his own residence on Saturday, January 10, 1730. </li>
			<li> It was named Shaniwarwada from the Marathi words Shaniwar (Saturday) and Wada (a general term for any residence complex). </li>
			<li> Teak was imported from the jungles of Junnar, stone was brought from the nearby quarries of Chinchwad, and Lime (mineral) was brought from the lime-belts of Jejuri. Shaniwarwada was completed in 1732, at a total cost of Rs. 16,110, a very large sum at the time. </li>
			<li> The opening ceremony was performed according to Hindu religious customs, on January 22, 1732, another Saturday chosen for being a particularly auspicious day. </li>
			<li> Later the Peshwas made several additions, including the fortification walls, with bastions and gates; court halls and other buildings; fountains and reservoirs. </li>
			<li> Currently, the perimeter fortification wall has five gateways and nine bastion towers, enclosing a garden complex with the foundations of the original buildings. It is situated near the Mula-Mutha River, in Kasba Peth. </li>

		<p class="p3"> History of Golkonda Fort </p>

		<ol>
			<li> Golkonda is also known as Golconda, Gol Konda or Golla Konda (Shepherds Hill) is a citadel & fort in Southern India and was the Capital of the medieval Sultanate of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty (c. 1518 - 1687), is situated 11 km (6.8 mi) west of Hyderabad. </li>
			<li> It is also a tehsil of Hyderabad district, Telagana, Indai. The Region is known for the mines that have produced some of the World's most famous <b> gems, including the Koh-i-Noor, the Hope Diamond, Nassak Diamond & the Noor-ul-Ain. </b></li>
			<li> Golkonda was originally known as Mankal. Golkonda Fort was built by the Kakatiya Dynasty as part of their western defenses along the lines of the Kondapalli Fort. </li>
			<li> The city & fortress were built on a granite hill that is 120 meters (390 ft) high, surrounded by massive battlements. </li>
			<li> the Forst was rebuilt & strenghtend by Rani Rudrama Devi & her successor Prataparudra. </li>
			<li> Later, the fort came under the control of the Musunuri Nayaks, who defeated the Tughlaqi army occupying Warangal. It was ceded by the Musunuri Kapaya Naidu to the Bahmani Sultanate as part of a treaty  in 1364. </li>
			<li> Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golkonda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487â€“1543), sent as a governor of Telangana, established it as the seat of his government around 1501. </li>
			<li> Bahmani rule gradually weakened during this period, and Sultan Quli formally became independent in 1538, establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty based in Golkonda. </li>
			<li> Over a period of 62 years, the mud fort was expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi sultans into the present structure, a massive fortification of granite extending around 5 km (3.1 mi) in circumference. </li>
			<li> It remained the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until 1590 when the capital was shifted to Hyderabad. The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose 7 km (4.3 mi) outer wall enclosed the city. </li>
			<li> The fort finally fell into ruin in 1687, after an eight year long siege leading to its fall at the hands of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. </li>
			<li> The Golkonda Fort used to have a vault where once the famous Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds were stored along with other diamonds.
