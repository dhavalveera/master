They took the remark to heart. For 30 years, Bika led a band of freebooters all over Rajasthan till he settled down in Bikaner. Most of what was built by those warriors, the Rathores, still stands, a testimony as much to the quality of the construction as to the arid conditions in Bikaner that retard decay. The city settles towards the northern Rajasthan and it features sand dunes in the vast golden desert. With the largest Camel Research and Breeding farms in the world, the city of Bikaner offers the best camel rides. The camels are beautifully adorned with local handicrafts. Alongside these general tourist attractions, the vibrant markets in Bikaner is a must visit. </p>

The golden sand beach and crystal clear water make it a lovely beach getaway. Alibaug, once the home of one of Shivaji’s bravest admiral Kanhoji Angre, is now the chi-chi address of celebrities who want to escape corporate warfare. According to the Bombay Gazette, Alibaug was never an important town — till Angre came along and made it an important Maratha base. Till then, it was known for its gardens and wells built by a wealthy Muslim trader called Ali, hence the name Alibaug. As it embraced by sea from three sides, it is also referred to as “Goa of Maharashtra”. </p>

The sal forests and vast meadows contain tigers (89 at last count) and leopards and support huge populations of deer and antelope, including the rare barasingha (deer). You’ll see plenty of langur monkeys, the odd gaur (Indian bison), maybe even a family or two of wild boar and the odd lonesome jackal or two.

It is the place where Prince Siddhartha Gautama while meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha. Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it. As a young man, following the ancient traditions of Hinduism, he sought out spiritual teachers. Inquiring of their knowledge, he diligently practiced various yogas and meditations. Seven years passed, the last three in extreme asceticism, yet still, he had not achieved his goal of enlightenment. </p>
